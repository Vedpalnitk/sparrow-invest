# Sparrow Invest build notes
- Stack: Next.js (pages router) + TypeScript + TailwindCSS.
- Branding: Sparrow blue (#006BFF) with gradient (#3A7BFF → #0044FF), rounded 16px cards, light shadows.
- Implemented core layout (Navbar, Footer, PageHeader) and AI portfolio dashboard with investor profile, allocation mix, fund recommendations, AI signals, and watchlist.
- Fund universe and detail scaffolds added with core/growth/stability groupings, category grid, fund metadata (returns, risk, expense ratio, AUM, exit load), holdings, and manager info.
- Investor profile flow now captures detailed personal, financial, goal, and risk inputs with persona preview and completeness meter.
- Next steps: enrich fund data coverage, add goal stress tests, model tax-optimized ELSS routing, and add responsive/accessibility polish.
